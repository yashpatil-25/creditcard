üõ°Ô∏è Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world data. This project explores both supervised and unsupervised approaches, supported with proper data preprocessing and model evaluation techniques.

üîç Features & Techniques

Dataset: creditcard.csv ‚Äî contains transaction data including anonymized features and class labels (fraudulent or not).

Data Preprocessing:

Handled null values and removed duplicate entries.

Used boxplots for outlier detection and feature distribution analysis.

Applied StandardScaler for scaling features like Time and Amount.

Stratified train-test split for balanced evaluation.

| Algorithm                        | Type         | Notes                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**    | Supervised   | Used `n_neighbors=5`, accuracy evaluated post-scaling.           |
| **K-Means Clustering**           | Unsupervised | Clustering anomaly detection; compared clusters with true class. |
| **Decision Tree Classifier**     | Supervised   | Simple and interpretable; evaluated with accuracy.               |
| **Random Forest Classifier**     | Supervised   | Ensemble of decision trees, robust to overfitting.               |
| **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** | Supervised   | Good for high-dimensional data; trained on scaled features.      |


üìä Evaluation
Used Accuracy Score to measure model performance.

Visual analysis via boxplots for each model to observe feature distribution and detect anomalies.
